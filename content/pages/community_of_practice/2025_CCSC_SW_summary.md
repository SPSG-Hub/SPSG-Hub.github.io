# 2025 CCSC SW Tutorial

At the [2025 CCSC Southwest Region Conference](https://www.ccsc.org/southwestern/2025/index.php) we organized a tutorial session on project feasibility. We presented an overview of the general challenges that arise with service-learning projects, and the key issues that we have identified and included on our project feasibility rubric. Participants were given copies of our rubric and our conversation guide for evaluating potential projects and were presented with two mock scenarios with potential projects and mock partners. The mock scenarios were largely based on authentic interations we had with potential partners, one of which turned into a course project, and another that did not. Participants formed small groups and used the rubric and conversation guide to come up with questions for the mock partner to clarify the project scope and see if it could be narrowed down to a feasible project.

The primary project feasibility concerns that arose from the tutorial discussions fell into the following categories:

- Hosting and maintenance of delivered products
- Handling of sensitive data
- Partner availability throughout the semester
- Project timeline

Participants also had numerous questions about SPSG and how we conduct our courses, including:

- How do you form teams?
- How long do you spend in the elaboration phase?
- What do you do when a partner stops communicating?
- Do you explicitly cover good teamwork skills before the elaboration phase?
