# 2025 SIGCSE BoF

At the [2025 SIGCSE Technical Symposium](https://sigcse2025.sigcse.org/) we
organized a [Birds of a Feather
session](https://doi.org/10.1145/3641555.3705099) focusing on best practices in software projects with community partners to share ideas and continue building a community of
practice. Participants discussed concerns and challenges of working with community partners, and shared wisdom and insights gained from
teaching courses that involve working with such partners. Below is a summary of the discussions during the BoF.



## Workload & Time Commitment, Logistics & Institutional Support

### Concerns:

-   Service learning requires additional work for both faculty and
    students.

-   Balancing service projects with existing coursework can be
    challenging.

-   Administrative tasks (e.g., paperwork, approvals, and coordination)
    can be overwhelming.

-   Need for clear guidelines on integrating service learning into the
    curriculum.

-   Lack of institutional incentives or support structures for faculty.

-   Bureaucratic delays in approvals and funding.

-   Concerns about fairly assessing student contributions.

### Best Practices & Mitigation Strategies:

-   Having administrative support (e.g., a service-learning office)
    reduces faculty workload.

-   Using **standardized templates** for agreements and project
    guidelines makes adoption easier and simplifies repeat use.

-   Aligning service-learning projects with **existing course
    objectives** ensures integration without excessive additional
    effort.

-   **Replacing** traditional assignments with service-learning projects
    (instead of adding extra work) reduces student and faculty burden.

-   Setting **realistic expectations** by starting with small,
    manageable projects before scaling up.

## Finding & Maintaining Community Partnerships

### Concerns:

-   Ensuring a strong match between student projects and community
    needs.

-   Some community partners may be unreliable or inconsistent.

-   Difficulty in securing long-term partnerships that align with
    academic schedules.

-   Need for Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) or other formal
    agreements to set expectations.

### Best Practices & Mitigation Strategies:

-   Establishing **clear agreements (e.g., MoUs)** helps define
    expectations and ensures smooth collaboration.

-   Having a **dedicated liaison** between the university and community
    partners improves communication and alignment.

## Student Readiness & Engagement

### Concerns:

-   Varying levels of student motivation---some may not take service
    learning seriously.

-   Ensuring students are adequately prepared for real-world
    interactions.

-   Potential for negative student experiences if projects are not
    well-structured.

### Best Practices & Mitigation Strategies:

-   Structuring projects **around students' skills and interests**
    increases engagement and motivation.

-   Providing **clear guidelines and training** before engagement leads
    to better student performance and confidence.

-   **Reflection activities** (journals, structured discussions) help
    students connect their work to course concepts and personal growth.

## Project Scope & Impact

### Concerns:

-   Ensuring projects are meaningful and beneficial for both students
    and the community.

-   Fear that projects may not be sustainable beyond the semester.

-   Aligning service-learning goals with course learning objectives.

### Best Practices & Mitigation Strategies:

-   Designing projects with **long-term sustainability** in mind
    benefits both students and community partners.

-   Encouraging **multi-semester or multi-cohort participation** ensures
    continuity in service projects.
