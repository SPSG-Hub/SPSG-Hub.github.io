# Scaffolded Projects for the Social Good

------------

Scaffolded (Computing) Projects for the Social Good (SPSG) is an NSF-funded collaboration
between [Central Connecticut State University](https://www.ccsu.edu/) and
[Xavier University](https://www.xavier.edu/).

The project goal is to develop resources to assist computer science faculty who
wish to embed **community-based service-learning projects** into their
curriculum. While not specific to our recommendations, we focus on projects and
project partners (e.g. local non-profits) that illustrate **computing's
potential for positive social impact.**

See the [About]({{< ref "about" >}}) page for an overview and information about
us. See the [Structure Guide]({{< ref "structure_guide" >}}) and other
resources in the site menu to start exploring our framework.
